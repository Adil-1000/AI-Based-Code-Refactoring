# 🤖 AI-Based Code Refactoring

This project is about using **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** to automatically clean and improve computer code. It helps developers write better, easier-to-read, and more organized code without changing how the program works.

---

## 📌 What is Code Refactoring?

Code refactoring means improving the structure of existing code to make it:

* Easier to understand
* Easier to maintain
* Less error-prone

It doesn’t add new features but helps make the code cleaner and better.

---

## 💡 Project Idea

In most cases, developers have to refactor code manually, which:

* Takes a lot of time
* Can be boring
* Needs experience

So, we created an AI-based system that:

* Takes code as input
* Finds bad or messy parts
* Suggests or applies improvements using machine learning

---

## ✅ Key Features

* Supports languages like **Python** and **Java**
* Removes unnecessary code
* Renames variables with better names
* Makes code easier to read and understand
* Gives you a preview before making changes
* Can be used with a simple web interface or API

---

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies Used

* **Python** (Main language)
* **Machine Learning Models** (CodeLLaMA, StarCoder)
* **VS Code / PyCharm** (for development)
* **Flask / FastAPI** (for the web API)
* **Git** (for version control)

---

## 📋 Requirements

### Software:

* Python 3.8 or higher
* VS Code / PyCharm
* Flask or FastAPI
* ML libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch

### Hardware:

* At least 8GB RAM
* Intel i5 or Ryzen 5 processor
* GPU for training models (optional but helpful)

## 🚀 How It Works

1. User gives some source code
2. Code is cleaned and converted into a format the model can understand
3. AI checks for problems and suggests better code
4. User sees the improved code and can choose to use it

---

## 🔍 How It Learns

We trained the model using open-source code from websites like GitHub. The model learns how good code looks and applies the same improvements to new code.

---

## 📈 Results

* Code becomes easier to read
* Less unnecessary code
* Better variable and function names
* Helps in reducing bugs and improves quality

---

## 🔮 Future Scope

* Can be added to code editors like VS Code
* Real-time suggestions while typing
* Cloud or local deployment
* Show reasons for each suggested change
